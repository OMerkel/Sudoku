<p><em>Sudoku</em> implements the well-known number puzzle. Objective
  of Sudoku is to fill the empty cells with digits ranged from 1 to 9
  in a valid pattern. Some cells are already holding fixed digits and
  cannot be edited. A valid pattern means that</p>
<ul>
<li>each row does not contain any duplicate of digits, and</li>
<li>each column does not contain any duplicate of digits, and</li>
<li>each of the nine three-times-three subgrids does not contain any
  duplicate of digits.</li>
</ul>
<p>On clicking an empty cell it gets marked by a question mark symbol.
  The question mark indicates that no specific number is selected for
  this cell so far. Now you can select a digit ranged from 1 to 9 to
  fit in the cell. To clear the cell a question mark can be
  reselected, too.</p>
<h3>Some hints and facts</h3>
<p>The Sudoku generator in use here is explicitly not only supporting
  symmetric cell patterns that often can be found in other Sudokus.</p>
<p>This type of number puzzle does actually not have Asian origin.
  Anyway it got popular under the name Sudoku being published by a
  Japanese puzzle company in mid 1980s. Sudoku is an abbreviation
  of the Japanese <i>Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru</i>. This could be
  translated to <i>Digits must be singletons</i>.</p>
<p>Any Sudoku solution represents a form or relation towards so
  called Latin square in a Mathematical sense.</p>
